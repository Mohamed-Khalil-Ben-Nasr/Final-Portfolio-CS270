# Final Reflection
Based on my performance in this class, I confidently award myself the grade of A. Throughout the course, I consistently demonstrated a strong commitment and dedication to my studies, putting in the necessary effort to excel.
My understanding of designing and implementing data structures has significantly improved, evident from active participation in class discussions, completion of challenging homework assignments, individual tests, and collaborative group exams. I have made remarkable progress in my ability to comprehend and write code computationally, as well as in my knowledge of data structures, their implementations, advantages, and tradeoffs. Comparing my current level of expertise to when I initially embarked on this course, the difference is truly remarkable.
I consistently engage with the course material by thoroughly preparing for each class, diligently completing the readings on Perusall. Furthermore, I go above and beyond the assigned material by seeking additional resources, such as YouTube videos, to deepen my understanding further.
Engaging in self-reflective grading has been a regular practice for me, and I have also proactively sought meetings with the professor to discuss my progress and growth. I have wholeheartedly embraced constructive feedback, using it to address any shortcomings or challenges encountered during my work on data structures.
In conclusion, this class has been an immensely rewarding and informative journey for me. It has not only expanded my knowledge of data structures but has also contributed to my personal and professional growth.
